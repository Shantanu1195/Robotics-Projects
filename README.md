# Robotics-Projects

1. Make a MATLAB function ‚Äú[s,s_dot,s_ddot] = S_curve(t,amax,vmax,s0,sf)‚Äù to generate a
real-time S-curve, and test it either in Simulink or .m file. The results submitted should
include both the S_curve function codes and the executable Simulink or .m testing file.

2. For the planar two-link manipulator. Creating a .m file to simulate the response of the
system for time ùë°. The .m file contains the plot of the joint angles.

3. In Simulink, using Simscape components to construct the dynamic model of a robot and a 
customized small damping coefficient for each joint, to simulate the response.

4. For the model you constructed in Problem 3, adding motion control components.
